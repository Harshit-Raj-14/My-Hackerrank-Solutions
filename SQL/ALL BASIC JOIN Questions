SELECT SUM(CITY.POPULATION) FROM CITY
JOIN COUNTRY
ON CITY.COUNTRYCODE = COUNTRY.CODE
WHERE COUNTRY.CONTINENT ='ASIA';


African Cities
SELECT CITY.NAME FROM CITY
JOIN COUNTRY
ON CITY.COUNTRYCODE = COUNTRY.CODE

/////INNER JOIN ALSO WORKS HERE


Average Population of Each Continent
SELECT COUNTRY.CONTINENT, FLOOR(AVG(CITY.POPULATION))
FROM CITY
JOIN COUNTRY 
ON CITY.COUNTRYCODE = COUNTRY.CODE
GROUP BY COUNTRY.CONTINENT;
//For some reason round integer does not work, use floor method. Also, note the use case of group by reason being :
//When you use an aggregate function like AVG() in SQL, it performs the calculation within each group defined by the GROUP BY clause.
