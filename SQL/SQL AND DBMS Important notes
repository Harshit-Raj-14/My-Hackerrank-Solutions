A file with . sql extension is a Structured Query Language (SQL) file.
ACID -> 
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete)
-- is used to comment SQL queries.

Query all attributes => Query all columns => SELECT * FROM db_name.table_name;


/* NESTING SELECT QUERIES */
SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N=(SELECT MAX(LAT_N) FROM STATION WHERE  LAT_N<137.2345);
//Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.2345. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.







SOME SYNTAX COMMANDS:

SELECT DISTINCT(column_name) FROM table_name;

/* SQL WHERE function */
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE NAME = 'Ramesh';
SELECT * from CUSTOMERS WHERE NAME IN ('Khilan', 'Hardik', 'Muffy');    //WHERE Clause with IN Operator
SELECT * from CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE NOT IN (25, 23, 22);    //WHERE Clause with NOT IN Operator
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE NAME LIKE 'K___%';    //WHERE Clause with LIKE Operator => Syntax: WHERE column_name LIKE pattern; => The WHERE clause with LIKE operator allows us to filter rows that matches a specific pattern. This specific pattern is represented by wildcards (such as %, _, [] etc).
//the query would display all the records where the name starts with K and is at least 4 characters in length

SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE (AGE = 25 OR salary < 4500) AND (name = 'Komal' OR name = 'Kaushik');    //WHERE Clause with AND, OR Operators



/* SQL SUM() function */
Syntax:
SELECT SUM(column_name) as give_a_new_table_name_to_this_sum FROM table_name;

SELECT SUM(SALARY) as summation from CUSTOMERS;
Output
+-----------+
| summation |
+-----------+
| 35000.00  |
+-----------+

Now, suppose based on the above table we want to calculate the summation of distinct (unique) age of the customers
SELECT SUM(DISTINCT AGE) as summation from CUSTOMERS;

SELECT SUM(Salary) AS summation FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE > 24;    //the summation of the salary of all customers whose age is greater than 24


SELECT AGE, SUM(SALARY) as sal_sum from CUSTOMERS GROUP BY AGE HAVING SUM(SALARY)> 5000;
//query returns the age of all the customers having salary greater than 5000. Since there are two customers with same age, one of whose salary is greater than 5000, so their salary is summed up


/* SQL ROUND() function */
Syntax: SELECT ROUND(column_name, your_scale) FROM table_name;    //your_scale->desired scale for rounding

QUERY-> following two values from the STATION table: The sum of all values in LAT_N rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places. The sum of all values in LONG_W rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places.
SELECT 
ROUND(SUM(LAT_N),2) as lat, 
ROUND(SUM(LONG_W),2) as lon 
FROM STATION;

Note : if you want to round to nearest integer just make the scale 0.



/* SQL - COUNT Function */
Syntax: SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name;     //ounting the number of records

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee_tbl ;
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|        7 |
+----------+

SELECT (COUNT(CITY) - COUNT(DISTINCT(CITY))) FROM STATION;  // difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table. 



/* SQL - ORDER BY Clause */
syntax - SELECT column_name FROM table_name ORDER BY table_name ASC/DSC;    //SQL ORDER BY clause is used to sort the data in either ascending or descending order

Note: WHERE function if you are using any condition comes before order by.
Logic--- firs tyou find the column data using condtion, then only you sort all of them

/* SQL - MAX Function */
Syntax: SELECT MAX(column_name) -> FROM table_name;


/* SQL LENGTH FUNCTION */
Syntax: SELECT LENGTH(column_name) as new_clumn_name_you_want FROM table_name;
SELECT LENGTH(CITY) as city_length FROM STATION;    //print length of all the data in that column works for all data types

/* SQL - SUBSTRING() Function */
SELECT SUBSTRING('Hello World', 2, 5) AS NEW_STRING;
+------------+
| NEW_STRING |
+------------+
| ello       |
+------------+




/* SQL Server LEFT() Function */
The LEFT() function extracts a number of characters from a string (starting from left).
LEFT(string, number_of_chars)

Extract 5 characters from the text in the "CustomerName" column (starting from left):
SELECT LEFT(CustomerName, 5) AS ExtractString
FROM Customers; 


/* SQL REPLACE() Function */
The REPLACE() function replaces all occurrences of a substring within a string, with a new substring.
Syntax: REPLACE(string, old_string, new_string)
SELECT REPLACE('SQL Tutorial', 'SQL', 'HTML'); 



/* SQL CODE - FOR TYPE OF TRIANGLE */
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN A+B<=C OR A+C<=B OR B+C<=A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
        WHEN A=B AND B=C AND C=A THEN 'Equilateral'
        WHEN A=B OR B=C OR A=C THEN 'Isosceles'
        ELSE 'Scalene'
    END
as triangle_type
FROM TRIANGLES;


/* TOP EARNERS */
SELECT MAX(SALARY * MONTHS), COUNT(NAME) FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY * MONTHS = (SELECT MAX(SALARY * MONTHS) FROM EMPLOYEE);
//Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings.
