## Binary Search Tree
A tree in which all the elements in left subtree (child nodes in left) is less than the parent node, and all the elements in right subtree (child nodes in the right) are greater than the parent node. This condition will exist through each and every node.
This was done to make searching easier.

=> Each node has a maximum of two elements.

=> Search TC- O(nlogn)
