Problem Statement:
A forklift worker moves products from one place to the other in an automotive parts warehouse. 
There a map in the dashboard that shows, in real time, the open and blocked sections inside the warehouse. 
The map is displayed as an nxm matrix of 1's and O's which represent open and blocked sections respectively. 
A forklift driver always starts at the upper left corner of the map at warehouse[0][0] and tries to reach 
the bottom right section of the map or warehouse[n-1][m-1). Each movement must be in increasing value along a 
row or column but not both. Given the warehouse map, determine the number of distinct paths to get from 
warehouse[0][0] to warehouse[n-1][m-1). 
The number may be large, so return the value modulo (10 9 +7).
