The physicists of Hackerland are working on an algorithm to create waves. An array can be represented as a wave if either of the following conditions is satisfied:
• a1> a2 and a 2< a3 and a3> a4 and so on.
• a₁< a2 and a2> a3 and a3 a4 and so on.
where a[i] is the ith element of the array a.
Given an array arr of n integers, consisting of integers in the range 1 to m inclusive, or -1, find the number of ways to replace all the -1s in the array with an integer in the range 1 to m such that the resulting array can be represented as a wave. Since the answer can be large, compute it modulo 109 + 7.
Example
Suppose n = 3, arr= [-1, 3, -1], m = 3
The possible ways to replace all -1s in the array such that the resulting array is a wave array are-
• [1, 3, 2]
[1, 3, 1]
⚫ [2, 3, 1]
⚫ [2, 3, 2]
Hence the answer is 4.
