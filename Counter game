LOGIC ---
Louise plays first => chance=1;(always odd)
Richard takes next move => chance=2;(always even)
So, at whatever kind of chance the n becomes one the person wins.
Two operations:
if n is power of 2 divide it by 2
if n is not power of 2 subtract it with the nearest smaller power of 2

We made two different functions to find the above two conditions
