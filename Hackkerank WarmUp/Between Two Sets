LOGIC ---
a[]
b[]
We have to find x such that:
x is multiple of first array
x is factor of second array

eg: a:[2,6]
b:[24,36]

Multiples of first array:
2 = 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,....
6 = 6,12,18,24,30,36,....

Factors of second array:
24 - 2,3,4,6,8,12
36 - 2,3,4,6,9,12,18

Common numbers from a and b are - x=6,12
