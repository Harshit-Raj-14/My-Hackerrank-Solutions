LOGIC ---
eg - 71
71>38
71%5!=0
71%5=1 
Our advantage is that only foorward rounding is allowed
When taking %5 of some number we will be dividing them with a multiple of 5 that is less than or equal to grade.
71 was divided by 70 and remaidner is 1.
Differnece between 71 and 75 is 4.
We want the differnece to be less than 3.
So, 71 remains 71.
Same with 72 and remainder is 2
At 73 remainder when divided by 70 is 3 and difference between 75 and 73 is 2.
So, instead of using the condition given in the problem of saying -
"If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5."
We can conversely say that the modulo of grade with 5 should be >=3. And we will just tkae the next multiple of 5. either by adding 


grade remainder difference-with-next-multiple
70      0           5
71      1           4
72      2           3
73      3           2   (do roundup)
74      4           1   (do roundup)

differnece-with-next-multiple-of-5 = 5 - remainder
grade + difference-with-next-multiple= next-multiple-of-5
So,
next-multiple-of-5 = grade + (5 - remainder) = grade + (5 - grade%5)
