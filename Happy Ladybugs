/*
Logic---
Simple logic is that when colors occur together they are happy.
If you there are more than one color they can always be clubbed together to make them happy.
Hence if there is only one color it will always be sad.
So, if there is occurence of just one color a ladybug will be sad.
And we cna never make them happy.
Just like my life.
EDGE CASE : There should be alteast one _ there to make the swaps posisble.
But still there is another edge case where what if actually there was never the need to swap. eg :BBB should pass.
